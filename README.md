# Database-Backup-Strategy-Implementation
This project implements a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy for the AdventureWorks2022 database using SQL Server Agent jobs. The solution ensures data protection through scheduled full, differential, and transaction log backups with point-in-time recovery capabilities.
You're absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion. Let me provide you with the proper README.md file content that you can directly copy and paste into your GitHub repository.

# AdventureWorks Database Backup Strategy Implementation

## üìã Practical Tasks Completed

### 1. Set Recovery Model to Full
```sql
USE master;
GO

ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2022 SET RECOVERY FULL;
GO

-- Verify recovery model
SELECT name, recovery_model_desc 
FROM sys.databases 
WHERE name = 'AdventureWorks2022';
```
**Result:** Database recovery model successfully changed to FULL.

### 2. Weekly Full Backup Job
**Job Name:** `AWK_FullBackup_Weekly`

**Schedule:** 
- Occurs every week on Sunday at 02:00:00
- Recurring weekly schedule

**Backup Command:**
```sql
-- Full backup with compression and checksum
BACKUP DATABASE [AdventureWorks2022]
TO DISK = @Path
WITH COMPRESSION, CHECKSUM, STATS = 10;
```

**Backup Location:** `C:\SQLBackups\AdventureWorks\`

### 3. Daily Differential Backup Job
**Job Name:** `diff_job`

**Backup Command:**
```sql
DECLARE @Path NVARCHAR(268) = N'C:\SQLBackups\AdventureWorks\AdventureWorks2022_DIFF_'
+ REPLACE(CONVERT(VARCHAR(19),GETDATE(),120),':','-') + '.bak';

BACKUP DATABASE [AdventureWorks2022]
TO DISK = @Path
WITH DIFFERENTIAL, COMPRESSION, CHECKSUM, STATS = 10;
```

### 4. Transaction Log Backups Every 2 Hours
**Job Name:** `AWK_LogBackup_2nj`

**Schedule:** Occurs every 2 hours daily

**Backup Command:**
```sql
DECLARE @Path NVARCHAR(266) = N'C:\SQLBackups\AdventureWorks\AdventureWorks2022_LOG_'
+ REPLACE(CONVERT(VARCHAR(19),GETDATE(),128),':','-') + '.txn';

BACKUP LOG [AdventureWorks2022]
TO DISK = @Path
WITH COMPRESSION, CHECKSUM, STATS = 10;
```

### 5. Restore Testing - Point-in-Time Recovery
Successfully tested restoring the database to a specific point in time using the backup chain:

**Restored Database:** `AdventureWorks2022_RestoreTest_PointTime`

**Process:**
1. Restored from full backup: `AdventureWorks2022_Full_2025-10-03 16:47:04.bak`
2. Applied subsequent differential and log backups
3. Verified successful database restoration

### 6. Backup Storage and Monitoring
**Backup Locations:**
- Primary: `C:\SQLBackups\AdventureWorks\`
- Secondary: `E:\Backups\AdventureWorks\`

**Backup Monitoring Query:**
```sql
USE msdb;
GO

SELECT
    bs.database_name,
    bs.backup_start_date,
    bs.backup_finish_date,
    bs.type,
    mf.physical_device_name,
    bs.backup_size / 1024 / 1024 AS BackupSizeMB
FROM dbo.backupset bs
JOIN dbo.backupmediafamily mf
    ON bs.media_set_id = mf.media_set_id
WHERE bs.database_name = 'AdventureWorks2022'
ORDER BY bs.backup_start_date DESC;
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Backup Types Used:
- **FULL (D):** Complete database backup
- **DIFFERENTIAL (I):** Incremental changes since last full backup
- **LOG (L):** Transaction log backups

### Backup Features:
- **Compression:** Reduces storage requirements
- **Checksum:** Validates backup integrity
- **STATS = 10:** Provides progress reporting during backup

### File Naming Convention:
- Full: `AdventureWorks2022_Full_YYYY-MM-DD HH-mm-ss.bak`
- Differential: `AdventureWorks2022_DIFF_YYYY-MM-DD HH-mm-ss.bak`
- Log: `AdventureWorks2022_LOG_YYYY-MM-DD HH-mm-ss.txn`

## üìä Backup History Analysis
The implementation successfully captured this backup chain with varying sizes showing database activity:

```
2025-10-04 14:56 - DIFFERENTIAL backup (2,141 KB)
2025-10-04 14:55 - DIFFERENTIAL backup (2,141 KB)
2025-10-04 14:53 - DIFFERENTIAL backup (72 KB)
2025-10-03 17:04 - LOG backup (15 KB)
2025-10-03 16:53 - DIFFERENTIAL backup (72 KB)
2025-10-02 12:27 - FULL backup (204,893 KB)
```

## üöÄ Benefits of This Implementation
